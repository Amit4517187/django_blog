RAG works by retrieving relevant information from a knowledge base (like company docs) before the LLM generates a response, improving accuracy and reducing \"hallucinations,\" making it useful for chatbots needing specific or current data. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRAG in Artificial Intelligence (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)\r\nFunction: Combines information retrieval with text generation to ground LLMs in specific data.\r\nProcess: When a user asks a question, the system first searches an external database (like vector databases) for relevant documents, then feeds those documents to the LLM as context to formulate a more accurate answer.\r\nBenefits: Provides access to current, private, or specialized knowledge without retraining the model, reduces hallucinations, and allows users to see sources.\r\nUse Cases: Internal company knowledge bases, customer service bots, or any application needing factual, up-to-date information. \r\nOther Meanings of \"Rag\"\r\nCLOTH: A piece of old, torn cloth, often used for cleaning (e.g., \"cleaning rags\").\r\nClothing: Worn-out, tattered clothing (e.g., \"dressed in rags\").\r\nNEWSPAPER: A low-quality newspaper or magazine (e.g., \"local rag\").", "created_date": "2026-01-21T20:15:31Z", "published_date": "2026-01-21T20:20:14Z"}}, {"model": "blog.post", "pk": 2, "fields": {"author": 1, "title": "LLM", "text": "An LLM (Large Language Model) is an advanced AI trained on massive text datasets to understand, generate, and process human language for tasks like chatbots, translation, summarization, and content creation, leveraging deep learning and transformer architectures for powerful pattern recognition and fluent responses. Key examples include OpenAI's GPT series, Google's Gemini, and Meta's Llama, forming the core of modern AI applications. \r\n\r\nHow LLMs Work\r\nDeep Learning & Transformers: LLMs use deep learning, specifically the transformer architecture, which allows them to process entire sequences of text in parallel, identifying relationships between words and understanding context more effectively than older models.\r\nMassive Training: They are trained on vast amounts of text (books, articles, web pages) to learn grammar, facts, reasoning, and different styles of writing.\r\nSelf-Supervised Learning: A key aspect is self-supervised learning, where models learn patterns from unlabeled data without explicit human labeling, making training more efficient.", "created_date": "2026-01-21T20:20:20Z", "published_date": "2026-01-21T20:22:19Z"}}, {"model": "blog.post", "pk": 3, "fields": {"author": 1, "title": "AI agents", "text": "AI agents are autonomous software systems that perceive their environment, reason, plan, and take actions to achieve goals, often using Large Language Models (LLMs) for understanding and decision-making, acting like digital workers that can handle complex tasks, automate workflows, and learn over time with minimal human oversight, going beyond simple chatbots to interact with tools, systems, and data. They can handle multi-step processes like booking appointments, managing marketing campaigns, or resolving customer queries by leveraging memory, reasoning, and external tools to adapt and improve. \r\nKey Characteristics:\r\nAutonomy: They can operate independently to reach objectives set by humans.\r\nPerception & Reasoning: They process information (text, audio, data) and use logic to decide on the best course of action.\r\nAction-Oriented: Unlike basic chatbots, they can act, using tools, APIs, and other systems to perform tasks.\r\nMemory & Learning: They retain context from past interactions and learn from outcomes, improving performance over time.\r\nTool Use: They know when and how to use external software, databases, or other AI models. \r\nHow They Work:\r\nGoal Setting: A user defines a high-level goal (e.g., \"Optimize my marketing campaign\").\r\nPlanning: The agent breaks the goal into smaller, actionable steps (subtasks).\r\nTool Use: It decides which tools (e.g., internal databases, cloud services, other AI models) are needed for each step.\r\nExecution & Feedback: It executes tasks, gathers results, and uses them to refine its plan, learning from success or failure. \r\nExamples & Applications:\r\nCustomer Support: Resolving queries, escalating when needed.\r\nSoftware Development: Generating code, automating IT tasks.\r\nMarketing: Optimizing campaigns, creating content.\r\nDigital Assistants: Booking meetings, managing calendars, sending emails. \r\nDifference from Chatbots:\r\nChatbots: Primarily generate text responses based on prompts.\r\nAI Agents: Generate responses and take autonomous actions using tools to complete multi-step workflows, acting more like a digital employee.", "created_date": "2026-01-21T20:22:24Z", "published_date": "2026-01-21T20:23:48Z"}}, {"model": "blog.post", "pk": 4, "fields": {"author": 1, "title": "sample title", "text": "Test", "created_date": "2026-01-24T08:07:06.941Z", "published_date": "2026-01-24T11:07:38.475Z"}}, {"model": "blog.post", "pk": 5, "fields": {"author": 1, "title": "GEN AI", "text": "Generative AI (GenAI) is a subset of artificial intelligence that creates new, original content—including text, images, code, audio, and video—based on prompts.
